# About the service

The Australian Nextflow Seqera Service provides access to a centralised web platform for managing, launching and monitoring the execution of Nextflow bioinformatics pipelines on [Seqera-compatible compute environments](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/latest/compute-envs/overview). Australian research organisations and individual researchers can add compute infrastructure they have access to and publish pipelines to private or shared workspaces to run data analyses at scale. The service provides access to all features available through the [Seqera Platform](https://seqera.io/platform/) including data exploration and analysis as well as notebook analysis.

# Operational Partners

[Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) (whose lead agent is [the University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/)) operates the Australian Nextflow Seqera Service in collaboration with [Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre](https://pawsey.org.au/), [National Computational Infrastructure (NCI)](https://nci.org.au/), and [Seqera](https://seqera.io/). The Service was established as an output of the Australian BioCommons [Bring Your Own Data Expansion Project](https://www.biocommons.org.au/byo-data-platform-expansion) and is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is supported by [Bioplatforms Australia](https://www.bioplatforms.com/) via [NCRIS funding](https://www.education.gov.au/ncris).
